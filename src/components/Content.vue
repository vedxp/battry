  <Card>Success doesn't come from what you do occasionally, but what you do consistently.</Card>
  <Card>Success = Write down all your fears and title it To Do List.</Card>
  <Card>Take time to improve, but don't waste time to prove.</Card>
  <Card>Hurt in private, heal in silence and shine in public.</Card>
  <Card>Nothing can hurt you, if you enjoy being alone.</Card>
  <Card>If your salary is your only source of income, you're one step ahead of poverty.</Card>
  <Card>Be the reason someone smile today, but remember you're someone too.</Card>
  <Card>You think you know me, wrong, you only see what I choose to show you.</Card>
  <Card>Being alone is better than being in bad company.</Card>
  <Card>I don't care who is doing better than me, because I am doing better than I was last year.</Card>
    <!--10-->
  <Card>Learn to make more moves and less announcements.</Card>
  <Card>Die with memories, not dreams.</Card>
  <Card>Be who you are, and make everyone love that person.</Card>
  <Card>Easy choices hard life, hard choices easy life; choice is yours.</Card>
  <Card>If people have problem with you, it's their problem, not yours.</Card>
  <Card>Faking a smile is much easier than explaining why you're sad.</Card>
  <Card>Learn to be alone, because no one will stay forever.</Card>
  <Card>Be yourself, because an original is much more than a copy.</Card>
  <Card>Loyal partners are hard to find, because they are busy in building their carrier.</Card>
  <Card>Be thankful for what you have, you'll end up having more; if you concentrate on what you don't have, you'll never ever have enough.</Card>
